Introduction to Blender
===
###### tags: `Visualization`

Prerequisite:

1. Download [blender](https://www.blender.org/download/). The version of blender we use in this tuotrial is 2.93.5
2. Having a mouse with scroll wheel helps navigating in the blender viewport a lot.
3. Checkout the github repo for [this tutorial](https://github.com/kazewong/Blender_volume_tutorial). 
4. If you want to convert your custom .npz into a .vdb, you also need to install pyopenvdb, which requires python version = {3.7,3.8}. Depending on your python version, you can do either pip install pyopenvdb or pyopenvdb-3.8. This has only been tested on linux (and confirmed fail on Mac), so it could be non-trivial depending what environment you are working in and what access you have. Skip ahead if you cannot get this part and contact me for installation guide afterward.

Notes:
1. I capture the screen on a 4K monitor, so the images could look a bit small here. If you have trouble reading it, you can right click the images to open it in a new tab, then zoom into region you want to check.
2. If you open the this manual in .html with a browser, the layout should look better than the one in markdown.

# Setting up the workspace

1. Open blender, follow the quick setup menu. Then choose a general new file.
2. Go to the `World properties` tab on the right panel (Click the red Earth icon). Set the background of the world to black. You should not see any change in the background color yet.

2. Change the render engine from Eevee to Cycles (Click the Camera icon). If you have a gpu, you can also change the device to gpu. ![](https://i.imgur.com/ZHPWwDu.png)
3. Go to `Edit->Preferences->Input`, and enable `emulate Numpad`. This will drastically increase your ability to navigate in the viewport without a number pad.
4. Go to `Edit->Preferences->Add-ons`, search for `Node Wrangler` and enable it.

# Importing volume data into blender

* If you have not installed pyopenvdb, skip the first two steps and use the .vdb file provided.

1. Download the datafile 'IllustrisTNG_128.npz'
2. In a command line shell, run `python script npz_to_vdb.py`, you should have the file`CCA_tutorial_illustrisTNG.vdb`
3. Open blender, start with a general new file.
4. Delete the default cube by <kbd>left click</kbd> the cube to select it, then press <kbd>x</kbd> to delete it.
5. Press <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd> to open the drop down menu for adding object, choose volume->ImportOpenVDB. Choose the vdb file you just created with the python script. ![](https://i.imgur.com/7Hq71qY.png) 
6. You should have something like this ![](https://i.imgur.com/j9Ku16s.jpg)
7. Change `clipping` to 0. Then play around with `density` to see the structure of `Mgas`. Start with setting `density` to 1000.
8. Check the temperature field `T` and metallicity field `Z` as well.
9. Your view should look some like the following picture at this point. ![](https://i.imgur.com/3z6mrB2.jpg)

# Basic navigation
1. Center the cube at the origin by setting `transform->location X,Y,Z` in `object properties` to -0.5. ![](https://i.imgur.com/taDr9yd.png)
2. Scroll up the scroll wheel to zoom into the object.
3. Press down the scroll wheel then drag to rotate around the object.
4. Try `walk navigation` in the `View->Navigation` menu, then use <kbd>W</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd> <kbd>S</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd> together with your mouse to navigate around the cube.
5. Press <kbd>`</kbd> to call the view menu, pick a few to see the cube in different angle.
6. Pick an angle you like, then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>0</kbd> to set the camera to the current view.


# Basic shading

1. Right click the vertical boundary of the 3D viewport and the properties tab, choose `Vertical split`, the drag to the left to create a new split in the workspace. ![](https://i.imgur.com/pG5vDeA.png) ![](https://i.imgur.com/eCVLNqq.png)
2. Go to the top left of the right split. Click the dropdown menu and pick `Shade Editor`. ![](https://i.imgur.com/3xJOJwn.png)
3. Go to the top and press `+ new`, that should add some material nodes in the split. ![](https://i.imgur.com/yeiZH26.png) 
You should see the following nodes. ![](https://i.imgur.com/EKBBmvm.png)
4. Go to the top right of the left split, select the right most icon as shown in the figure below. This will change the viewport from 3D viewport to the render viewport. ![](https://i.imgur.com/T2zrtQ4.png)


## Emission strength

The first thing we want to work on is to make our volume luminous.

1. Set the 'density' field to 0.
2. Delete the input for `Density Attribute` and `Temperature Attribute`.
3. Press <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd> to call the add node menu. Search for the `Attribute` node and add it. Put `Mgas` in the `Name` field.
4. Drag the `Fac` node and drop it in `Emission Strength` of the `Principled Volume` Node. You should see an empty black background in the render viewport now.
5. Call the add node menu with <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd> again to add a `Math` node (`Converter->Math`). Click the drop down menu and choose `Multiply` from the menu. Connect the output from the `Attribute` node to one of the `Value` input of the `Math` node, then connect the output of `Math` node to the `Emission Strength` of the `Principled Volume` node. Change the other `Value` input of the `Math` node to around 1000. You should then see the large scale structure of the volume data.
6. Right click the `Math` node then press <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>d</kbd> to duplicate the node. Drag and drop it to the connection between the `Attribute` node and the `Math` node. Change this node from `Multiply` to `Power`. Adjust the exponent to increase/decrease the contrast of the field.

This is how the node tree and the volume should look like at this stage.

## Color

The next thing we want is to add color to our volume.

1. Add another `Attribute` node to the node tree, set the name to `T`, which is the temperature of the field.
2. Add a `Converter->ColorRamp` node to the node tree, connect the output of the `Attribute` to the `Fac` input of the `ColorRamp` node, and connect the `Color` output to the `Emission Color` to the `Principled Volume` node.
3. Duplicate the `Power+Multiply` nodes from the Emission stength part, then apply to the output of the `Attribute` node with `T` as its name. Adjust that until you have a satisfying result in the color.

This is how the node tree and the volume should look like at this stage.

## Absorption
1. Add another `Attribute` node to the node tree, set the name to `Z`, which is the metalicity of the field.
2. Add a `Shader->Volume absorption` node to the node tree, connect the output of the `Attribute` to the `Density` input of the `Volume absorption` node.
3. Add a `Shader->Add Shader` node to the node tree.
4. Combine the `Volume` output of both the `Principled Volume` nodeand the `Volume absorption` node into the input of `Add Shader`, then connect the output of `Add Shader` to the `Volume` attribute of the `Material Output`.
5. You can adjust the stength and contrast of the absorption using the `Power+Multiply` node again.

The absorption is a more subtle effect that is more interesting when you fly through the volume.

This is how the node tree and the volume should look like at this stage.

# Camera movement

The next thing we will work on is to move a camera around the volume to create a rotating view of the volume.

1. Go back to the normal 3D viewport ![](https://i.imgur.com/temDOEM.png)
2. Use <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd> to add an `Empty->Plain axes` object to the scene.
![](https://i.imgur.com/cUadjSw.png)
2. Add a `Curve->Circle` to the scene
![](https://i.imgur.com/MCbTTXt.png)
3. Left click the circle you just created. Press <kbd>s</kbd> and drag to scale the circle to a larger size. Then left click to confirm the change. After that, press <kbd>g</kbd> then <kbd>z</kbd> to grab the circle and move it along the z-axis.
![](https://i.imgur.com/4Y7DJt4.png)
4. Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to enter the edit mode. Select one of the node point on the circle, then press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>s</kbd> and selection `Cursor to Selected` to move the 3D cursor to the node point. Hit <kbd>Tab</kbd> again, when you are done.
![](https://i.imgur.com/dILmp8Z.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/shteSBD.png)
5. First select the Camera, then hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> and select the circle. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd> to pull the parent menu. Choose `Follow Path` from the menu.
![](https://i.imgur.com/IqBWQai.png)
6. Left click somewhere else on the screen to deselect the objects. Then choose the camera again, go to the properties on the right and the icon with a crankshaft. Click `Add Object Constraint` then choose `Track To`. Then pick the `Target` to be the `Empty`.
![](https://i.imgur.com/wyZqrgw.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/YoaueLk.png)
7. Finally, select the circle we created, go to the properties tab with a curve on it, go to `Path Animation` field, and set `Frames` to 360. This will render 360 frames for the final video. It will take around 
![](https://i.imgur.com/V8O1idS.png)
8. Now go to the time sliders at the bottome, drag the time sliders around to see the camera moves. You can also go to the camera view with <kbd>`</kbd>.
![](https://i.imgur.com/FgAKip6.png)

We will let the a camera goes in circle 

# Rendering

1. Go to the panel on the right, click on the icon that look like a camera. Choose render and viewport to be 1. This drastically reduce the rendering time. Note that this is usually a terrible choice since there will be a lot of aliasing in the final render. But for our case this is actually fine. ![](https://i.imgur.com/Sh1yq9L.png)

2. On the same panel, click the third icon that look like a printer printing an image. Choose the `Frame End` to be 360, and change the output to a directory where you want to output the rendered images and video. You can also set the fps to 60 to have a smoother video. ![](https://i.imgur.com/4521UEJ.png)

3. Go to the top tab and press `Render->Render Animation`. This will generate a series of PNG in the folder you chose to be the output folder.![](https://i.imgur.com/OtgVvVF.png)

4. After finish rendering the series of PNG, switch one of the split to the `Video Sequencer` view. ![](https://i.imgur.com/pseSnU9.png)
5. Click `Add` on the top of the split. Choose `Image Sequence` and choose the series of png you just rendered.
6. Now go to the properties tab on the right and choose the render tab again. Change file format to `FFmpeg video`. Open the `Encoding` menu, choose the container to be `MPEG-4`, the `Output Quality` to be `Perceptually Lossless`, and `Encoding Speed` to be `Slowest`.![](https://i.imgur.com/8niauHn.png)
7. `Render->Render Animation` again and you should have the video!
